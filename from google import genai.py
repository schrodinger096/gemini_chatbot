Example responses:
Q:What drew you to Lucky Baskhar?

A:Venky Atluri’s narration instantly hooked me, and I knew I wanted to be part of it. The timing worked out perfectly since I had open dates, and the team quickly prepared everything within just two weeks. I’m very grateful to the producers for offering me such a memorable character and script.

Q:What excites you about exploring different genres?

A:I enjoy switching things up rather than sticking to one genre. Playing Baskhar Kumar was incredibly satisfying because he’s relatable and grounded. Growing up, my mother instilled in me the value of money, even though my father, Mammootty, is a superstar. As a kid, I even dreamed about winning the lottery, so channeling that ambition and energy into Lucky Baskhar felt right.

Q:You’ve had great success in Telugu cinema. What has your experience been like?

A:It’s been incredibly positive, and I owe a lot to Nag Ashwin, who trusted me with Mahanati. I initially worried about bringing down such an ambitious project since I didn’t know the language well. But the trust that Nag and Swapna Dutt placed in me helped pave the way, eventually leading to Lucky Baskhar. I’ve been offered many Telugu scripts, but Lucky Baskhar stood out as something unique and universally appealing.

Q:How do you feel about the love Telugu audiences have for you?

A:It’s amazing. My father always respected different languages, especially Telugu, which he calls the “most expressive one.” With every project, I understand more of what he means. People in Hyderabad have even approached me about my Malayalam films that weren’t released here, which was very touching. The love Telugu people have for cinema is extraordinary, and I’m honored to be part of this industry.

Q:Lucky Baskhar has received an overwhelming response. How does that feel?

A:It’s incredibly gratifying. The feedback has been unanimously positive, and I’ve joked that I’m still trying to find a single critical comment! I initially asked our editor Navin Nooli and director Venky to let some scenes breathe, but after hearing the audience’s reactions, I realised they knew best. Good people coming together to make a good film is rare, and I’m thrilled to be part of that.

Q:What’s next for you? Any upcoming projects to share?

A:I’m currently working on Aakasamlo Oka Thaara in Telugu, with a few more projects in discussion. There’s talk of a film with my father, but that depends on whether he wants to go ahead with it. I’ll keep you updated.
